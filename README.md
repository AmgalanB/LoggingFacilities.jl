# LoggingFacilities
Inspired by LoggingExtras.jl

Ideas
- Timestamp logger ( take any date format string, and uses
TransformerLogger to prepend log message with timestamp)
- One line logger (instead of printing every variable in separate lines, join them in a single line separed by spaces)
- JSON logger (convert all variables into a JSON string)
